# Solution for GitHub Push Protection Error

GitHub is blocking the push because there's an Apify API token in the git history (in an old version of data/nodes.db).

## Options:

### Option 1: Allow the Secret (Quickest)
1. Visit: https://github.com/vredrick/n8n-mcp/security/secret-scanning/unblock-secret/2zSCFPbnmOhs0HjbI3prNivoQGf
2. Click "Allow secret" (it's not your token, it's from the original repo)
3. Then push again:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Option 2: Create Fresh Repository (Cleanest)
Since the secret is embedded in git history from the original fork:

1. Delete the current repository on GitHub
2. Create a new one with the same name
3. Run these commands:

```bash
# Create fresh git repo without history
cd /Volumes/vredrick2/N8N\ Worflows/n8n-mcp
rm -rf .git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: n8n-mcp with SSE support

- Based on n8n-mcp v2.7.4
- Added SSE (Server-Sent Events) support for n8n MCP Client
- Ready for Railway deployment
- Clean database without embedded secrets"

# Add your GitHub repo as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/vredrick/n8n-mcp.git

# Force push (since it's a new repo)
git push -u origin main --force
```

### Option 3: Use GitHub's Web UI
1. Go to https://github.com/vredrick/n8n-mcp
2. Delete the repository
3. Fork directly from https://github.com/czlonkowski/n8n-mcp
4. Then add your changes via GitHub's web editor

## Recommendation
I recommend **Option 1** - just allow the secret since:
- It's not your API token
- It's from the original repository
- You've already rebuilt the database so the current version is clean
- This is the fastest way to deploy

Once pushed, you can deploy to Railway from GitHub!
